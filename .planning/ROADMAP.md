# Roadmap: Triggarr

## Overview

Triggarr is a single-process automation daemon that cycles through Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr's wanted/cutoff-unmet lists on a configurable schedule, with closed-loop download tracking. Security invariants (no API key in any HTTP response) are established from day one and never relaxed.

## v2.11 Never-Searched-First Search Queue Priority (Phase 76)

- [ ] **Phase 76: Never-Searched-First Search Queue** - Replace the integer-cursor walk with an ordered per-instance searched-log on `AppState` and a pure `prioritize_batch()` dispatcher that searches never-tried items first, tops up oldest-searched-first, marks on attempt, resets per pass, and prunes to eligible.

## Phase Details

### Phase 76: Never-Searched-First Search Queue
**Goal**: The scheduler remembers which items it has already searched (per instance, per queue) and prioritizes never-searched items each cycle, while staying behavior-identical to today on a cold start.
**Depends on**: Phase 75 (v2.10 shipped; builds on the existing `AppState`, `state.py` atomic `save_state()`, and the three `run_*_cycle` functions in `search/engine.py`)
**Requirements**: QUEUE-01, QUEUE-02, QUEUE-03, QUEUE-04, QUEUE-05, QUEUE-06, QUEUE-07, QUEUE-08, QUEUE-09, QUEUE-10, QUEUE-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each instance persists an ordered searched-log per queue in `state.json` — `missing_searched`/`cutoff_searched` lists of string IDs, oldest at the front; Radarr/Lidarr keyed by `id`, Sonarr by composite `"{seriesId}:{seasonNumber}"` so one season's mark never marks another season of the same series (QUEUE-01, QUEUE-02).
  2. `missing_cursor`/`cutoff_cursor` are gone from `AppState` and `slice_batch` is deleted; a pre-upgrade `state.json` carrying the old cursor keys (and no searched-logs) loads cleanly, is treated as everything-unsearched, and overwrites the stale keys on its next save — no migration step (QUEUE-03, QUEUE-07).
  3. Within a cycle, a fresh `prioritize_batch()` fills the (already `hard_max`-capped) batch with never-searched eligible items first in fetched API order, then tops up remaining slots with already-searched items oldest-searched-first; on an empty searched-log the batch is identical to today's first-cycle cursor walk, and existing cycle tests asserting search counts / history rows stay green (QUEUE-04, QUEUE-05, QUEUE-06, QUEUE-07).
  4. An item joins the searched-log the moment its search command fires — success or failure — so a persistently-failing item can never starve the queue; each cycle the log is pruned to currently-eligible IDs so grabbed/unmonitored/deleted items drop out and the log stays bounded (QUEUE-08, QUEUE-10).
  5. When every currently-eligible item in a queue has been searched, that queue's log clears and the existing `missing_pass`/`cutoff_pass` counter increments; the searched-log and the pass counter commit together only in the single atomic `save_state()` at cycle end, so they can never disagree (at-least-once), and the count-only refresh path (`refresh_*_counts`) remains queue-independent — it never reads or writes the searched-log (QUEUE-09, QUEUE-11).
**Plans**: TBD

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: UI-based password recovery (BACKLOG — promoted to v2.10 Track A)

**Status:** Promoted into v2.10 as Phases 72-73 (Track A). Retained here for historical context.
**Goal:** [Captured for future planning] Self-service password reset flow in the Triggarr web UI so a locked-out user never has to hand-edit `triggarr.toml`. Context: a user got locked out after logging out and corrupted auth by typing a plaintext value into the bcrypt `password_hash` field (silent failure — bcrypt compare against a non-hash always rejects). Current recovery requires clearing `username`/`password_hash` in the TOML and re-running `/setup`. Single-user app, so likely a recovery mechanism gated on host/filesystem access (e.g. a one-time reset token written to the config volume or logs) rather than email-based reset.
**Requirements:** RCOV-01..06 (v2.10)
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] Promoted to v2.10 Phases 72-73

### Phase 999.2: Count-only / dry-run refresh without searching (BACKLOG — promoted to v2.10 Track B)

**Status:** Promoted into v2.10 as Phase 74 (Track B). Retained here for historical context.
**Goal:** [Captured for future planning] Surface accurate missing & cutoff-unmet counts on demand WITHOUT triggering any indexer searches or advancing the search cursor. Context: today counting and searching are a single inseparable pass (`engine.py` fetches the full missing/cutoff lists — the source of accurate counts — then immediately slices a batch off the cursor and searches it). After a bulk quality-profile change a user wants to see the true post-change counts without launching a search wave. The expensive part (querying *arr for the lists) already exists; this is the existing cycle with the `search_movies` loop short-circuited. Design notes: (a) must NOT advance the cursor (nothing was searched, else next real cycle silently skips items); (b) prefer a thin shared fetch helper used by both the real cycle and the count-only path over a `count_only` flag tangling the hot path; (c) surface as a per-instance "Refresh counts" button and/or API endpoint.
**Requirements:** CNT-01..05 (v2.10)
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] Promoted to v2.10 Phase 74
